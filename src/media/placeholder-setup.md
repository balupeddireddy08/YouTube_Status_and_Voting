# Placeholder Images Setup

Until you provide your own images, you can use placeholder images for development. Here's how to set them up:

## For Certificates

1. Create placeholder images for each certificate with the following names:
   - `PCAP.png`
   - `AI-900.png`
   - `DP-900.png`
   - `AZ-900.png`
   - `Tableau_Desktop_Certified_Associate.png`
   - `Python_TSA.png`
   - `sql.png`
   - `html_js_bootstrap.png`

2. You can generate placeholder images using services like:
   - [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)
   - [PlaceIMG](https://placeimg.com/)
   - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

## For Projects

Create placeholder images with these names:
- `rag-chatbot.jpg`
- `genai-assistant.jpg`
- `docker-chatbot.jpg`
- `langraph-chatbot.jpg`
- `multi-agent.jpg`

## For Resume

Place your resume PDF in the root of the media folder with the name `resume.pdf`.

## Temporary Solution

Until you have all the images ready, you can temporarily revert to using online placeholder images by modifying the image paths in the respective component files.
